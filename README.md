Objectives:

Process Creation Hierarchy: To simulate process creation and destruction when implemented with linked lists.

Batch Process Scheduling: To calculate the timing parameters of batch processes based on different scheduling algorithms.

Banker's Algorithm: To implement resource allocation and demonstrate deadlock avoidance using the Banker's
algorithm.

Memory Allocation: To simulate memory allocation with hole-fitting algorithms (First-fit, Best-fit) and
implement deallocation and defragmentation of memory blocks.

Each project include a nameProject.md file that explains the specifications and requirements.
